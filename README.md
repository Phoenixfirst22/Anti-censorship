# Anti-censorship
It will convert each letter in your text to a symbol or to a letter from another language that looks similar. For example, "Hello World" becomes "Ἡ℮ĻĻø ШóŘLÐ".
The programme will not work everywhere, as not all chats allow all symbols or letters, so perhaps some letters or symbols will be invisible. Tested on Instagram and Tiktok.
Made for freedom of speech.
